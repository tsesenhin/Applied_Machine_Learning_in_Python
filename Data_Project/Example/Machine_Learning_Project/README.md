**Machine_Learning_Project Description**


1. Default_Prediction.ipyb

This project is looking to reduce losses from customers defaults by offering a new, lower-value card that supports balance management and helps customers avoid default. The task is to predict the probability of default for each customer. The data used to train the Random Forest Model is 'train.xlsx'. Otherwise, predictions are created for the 'test.xlsx' file.
