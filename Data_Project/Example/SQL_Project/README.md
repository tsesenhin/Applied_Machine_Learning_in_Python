#SQL_Project Description


1. Flight_Alternative_Route.SQL

This is a real-life project that I have undertaken while I was working for easyJet. For confidentiality purposes, I have replaced sensitive information with 'x' within the query. The purpose of the task is to illustrate potential flight alternatives should the original flight be disrupted, and the final result is expressed via Tableau. This query is created so that customers and crews would spend less time on querying potential flight replacements. The main output of the query is to produce direct and indirect flights.

Note, this query is written in Hive (SQL-alike) language.
